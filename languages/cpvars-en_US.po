Then, in your post or page you can insert <span class='code'>[cpvars]name[/cpvars]</span> and get content displayed.</p> <p>Useful if you have a value (a phone number, number of employees) in several pages that can change, so you can change this once from the admin.</p><p>There is also an option (that affects every shortcode in your site) to display shortcodes in areas where normally they are not.</p><p>It integrates also into TinyMCE by adding a menu.</p>"
